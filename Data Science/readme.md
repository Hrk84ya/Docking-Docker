# Data Science Environment with Docker & Jupyter

This project demonstrates how to create a data science environment using **Docker** and **Jupyter Notebooks**. The environment will come pre-configured with popular Python libraries like **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **scikit-learn** for data analysis and machine learning tasks.


## Technologies Used

- Docker
- Jupyter
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a consistent, reproducible environment for data science tasks by leveraging Docker and Jupyter Notebooks. Docker ensures that the environment is isolated and portable, and Jupyter provides an interactive interface for running Python code, analyzing data, and visualizing results.

### Key Features

- Pre-configured Docker container for Jupyter Notebooks
- Popular Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn
- Easy access to Jupyter through a web browser
