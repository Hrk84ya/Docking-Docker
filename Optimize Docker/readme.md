# Optimized Python Docker Image

This project demonstrates how to optimize a Docker image for a Python application by using minimal base images like **Alpine Linux** and implementing **multi-stage builds** to keep the image size as small as possible.


## Technologies Used

- Docker
- Python
- Alpine Linux

## Project Overview

In this project, we'll optimize a Docker image for a Python application that analyzes data using the `pandas` library. The objective is to create a lightweight image by leveraging Docker's multi-stage build feature and Alpine Linux base image.

By using multi-stage builds and Alpine Linux, you can significantly reduce the size of your Docker image while ensuring that your Python application runs smoothly. This method not only makes your Docker image leaner but also more secure and faster to deploy.
